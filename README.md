Realestate_managment_php  
========================

Base build from http://propertymanagement-software.org/property-management-download.php.   However this is being HIGHLY modified so at some point it will not represent the original work.  Please note: the base build DOES NOT WORK.  Please contact me (Or the original author, but he probably doesn't care since it hasn't been fixed in over 7 years!) and I can walk you through how to get it working.


No copyright can be found so I am making an assumption that there is NO copyright (as of 4/11/2014).  I do not want to be accused of stealing this, so I request anyone wanting to download this understand the original liscense( http://propertymanagement-software.org/property-management-license.php ) before doing so.  

This is a work in progress, and is in no way intended to be distributed or used.  Doing so may cause crashes, explosions, viruses(Natural and/or computer based), loss of some form of life somewhere.....  etc.   I am not responsible for any actions beyond my own, the ball is in your court if you continue on.
